# Deep-Comment-Toxicity-model
The development of a Deep Face Recognition Model with a Siamese Network represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision and biometric authentication. The project's successful implementation showcases the potential of deep learning and innovative network architectures to address complex facial recognition tasks.
•	Developed a deep learning model to identify toxic comments, contributing to safer online interactions.
•	Utilized a labeled dataset containing comments categorized as toxic or non-toxic.
•	Created a deep learning architecture, using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers
•	Applied text preprocessing steps like vectorization, padding, and embedding to prepare comments for model input.
•	Gained hands-on experience in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and model evaluation techniques
