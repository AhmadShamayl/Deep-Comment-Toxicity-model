Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for comment toxicity detection. The model leverages NLP techniques to preprocess the text data and trains a neural network to classify comments based on their toxicity levels.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled comments. Each comment is labeled as either toxic or non-toxic. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Architecture
The model architecture includes:

Text preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and embedding of text data.
Neural network layers: Convolutional layers, LSTM layers, and dense layers to process the embedded text data.
Output layer: A sigmoid activation function to output the probability of a comment being toxic.
Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:



pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train and evaluate the model, run the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository. You can follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Open the Jupyter notebook:


jupyter notebook Deep Comment Toxicity model.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Results
The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:

Precision: 0.878
Recall: 0.809
Accuracy: 0.498
These metrics indicate the model's ability to accurately classify toxic comments.
